# BSSD2019Module1
Handouts and course scripts from BSSD 2019 Module 1: Introduction to R

This repository has everything but the data. That means that if you clone it you'll need to put the data where it belongs, distributed over the days of the week. Not all that efficient at this stage, but it worked as we progressed through the course. Here's where to put things.

1. `01_Monday` -- all fine, we used `gapminder` package for data
2. `02_Tuesday` -- `caseid_aggr.sav`, [`HFC_ASFRstand_TOT.txt`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17L_DiPS6hCf00hh7XCp9KTKyjJTkhy8Y/view?usp=sharing)
3. `03_Wednesday` -- `HFC_ASFRstand_TOT.txt` (copy), `HMD.rds`, `HFCextremes.rds`
4. `04_Thursday` -- `CoaleData.rds`
5. `05_Friday` -- `B.rds`, `HFD.rds`

The repository includes all Lecture pdfs and all class scripts (called `ClassNotes.Rmd` in each folder), and all these things should knit properly if the data is placed where noted above.
